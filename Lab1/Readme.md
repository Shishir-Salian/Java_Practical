**Credit Card Validator**
The program takes the user input for credit card no. with minimum of 8 digits and maximum of 9 digits. Then it validates the card number based on several steps. We didn't use a switch-case in the provided code because switch-case is typically used when you have multiple discrete conditions or values to handle. In this case, the validation process follows a sequential series of steps (from Step a to Step f), where each step depends on the result of the previous one. There aren't specific conditions or cases that would vary for each step, so a linear control flow (like if-else or direct method calls) is more appropriate.

**Alphabet War Game**
This program is about a playful fight between letters, split into two teamsâ€”the left-side letters and the right-side letters in which each letter will be assigned with the strengths for both sides. First of all it will ask the user if they want to play with default strength or if the want to assign the new strengths. Then it will ask the user if they want to play in single turn or in 2 turns i.e left side and right side turn. After that it will ask users to give the input and based on input it calculate the strengths and it will declare if the left side wins or right side wins. After this program will ask the user if the want to play another round.
